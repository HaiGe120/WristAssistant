/// Bridges the iOS app and the watchOS app over `WatchConnectivity`. Each
/// target instantiates the same `SyncCoordinator.shared` (its own copy, since
/// the two apps run in separate processes) and they exchange three kinds of
/// state:
///
/// 1. **Endpoint list + active endpoint ID** — the iPhone is the source of
///    truth; the watch asks for the catalog on first activation and then
///    receives updates via the application-context snapshot.
/// 2. **API keys** — the keychain does NOT bridge between iOS and watchOS
///    (no shared access group is possible across the iOS/watchOS boundary),
///    so we mirror keys over the WC session and store them in each app's
///    own keychain. The transport is encrypted in transit and stays
///    on-device; this is the standard trade-off for a paired companion app.
/// 3. **Conversations and messages** — when a new chat or message lands on
///    one side, we publish it; on receipt we upsert by UUID into the local
///    SwiftData store. Each `Conversation` and `Message` already carries a
///    stable `id`, so merging is append-with-dedup and safe across
///    interleaved writes from both sides.
///
/// `updateApplicationContext` carries the latest endpoint snapshot (the
/// latest call wins, no queue), while `transferUserInfo` reliably queues
/// per-event payloads (new chat, new message) so they aren't lost if the
/// receiving device is briefly out of range.
